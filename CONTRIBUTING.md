# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **DXC Assure Digital Platform**. Whether it's a new feature request, a question, a bug report, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our internal community.

These contribution guidelines are the main entry point for those **Assure teams** who wish to contribute to this platform component. Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your contribution.

## Branching Strategy

We follow a **trunk-based development** approach for every platform-related GitHub repository. This means that _master_ branch is always at a releseable state with the latest changes. In other words, this branch contains a _release candidate_ version of the code that is picked up automatically by the Pull Pipeline and promoted through the Assure Platform Lifecycle Environments (DEV-TEST-STAGE-PROD) upon testing (aka the CI/CD process)

For that matter, it is important that every contributor (external or internal) follow the branching guidelines. 

1. If you are an external contributor (outside the DIaaS GitHub organization) then fork this repository and work there
2. If you are an internal contributor (inside the DIaaS organization) then create a branch out of _master_

    - For feature branches use the naming convention **feature/X** where _X_ is any given name for the feature (i.e. the JIRA User Story ID)
    - For bug fix branches use the naming convention **fix/X** where _X_ is any given name for the bug fix (i.e. the JIRA Bug ID )
    - For any other R&D type of work, just use free format names for branches (i.e. _myChanges_)

>**Note 1:** Release branches will be created automatically by the Release Service following the naming convention **release/X** wher _X_ is the release name (i.e. _release/20.1_)

>**Note 2:** it is very important to highlight some conventions with important implications for **Deploy Unit projects**:
>- Only _master, feature and fix_ branches will generate Silver Images during the Deploy Unit push pipelines
>- When working with _feature or fix_ branches, it is important that you synchronize the [Assure Terraform Modules](https://github.dxc.com/DIaaS/diaas-terraform-modules) repository branches with the Deploy Unit branches if necessary. This is, **if your feature requires changes both to the Deploy Unit and the Terraform Modules** then the _feature_ branch name must be created in both repositories with the exact same name. If the branch name does not match, the _master_ version of the Assure Terraform Modules will be taken.

    - If you are working on new feature, work against _master branch_
    - If you are working on a production hotfix, work against _release branch_

2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't worked on that already
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted
